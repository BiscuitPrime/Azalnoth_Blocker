Heavely based on : https://medium.com/@sharonzheng/how-to-create-a-simple-site-blocker-chrome-extension-9628c3a0487b, go check it out !

The Azalnoth Blocker App is an application to boost my focus and reduce the time wasted on other sites (looking at you, doom-scrolling reddit, facebook and the like).

In the future, and I find the time, I would like to make it so the user can add sites through a textbox in the pop-up. But, you know, we'll cross that bridge when we cross it...

## How to use

Simply download the project, go to **chrome://extensions/**, click on **"Developer Mode"** (_upper-right corner_) and then click on **"Load Unpacked"**. Select your downloaded project and voil√† !
